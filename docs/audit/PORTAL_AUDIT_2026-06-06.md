# TalkMate Full Portal Audit — 2026-06-06

Backend code audit + live UI clickthrough across all three portals.
Mode: incremental, portal by portal. Fix obvious/safe issues as found; catalogue the rest.
Order: Client → Admin → Sales rep → Shared (auth/webhooks/crons).
Fix branch: `feature/audit-fixes-jun06` (off `dev`). NOT merged/deployed — awaiting Irfan review + full pipeline.

Scope at start: 135 pages, 335 API routes, 34 crons, 845 source files.

## Severity legend
- **P0** — broken/live-customer-facing or data-loss / security. Fix now or escalate.
- **P1** — feature broken or wrong, not catastrophic. Fix this audit.
- **P2** — minor bug, UX, or polish. Catalogue, batch-fix.
- **P3** — note / tech-debt / nice-to-have.

## Status key
`OPEN` · `FIXED` · `NEEDS-IRFAN` (risky/live-agent/prod) · `WONTFIX`

## CLIENT PORTAL

### Code audit findings (4 parallel slice agents, 2026-06-06)

**Cross-cutting / systemic**

| # | Sev | Issue | Status |
|---|-----|-------|--------|
| C-1 | P1 | **`.single()` on `businesses`** — absolute rule-1 violation. Throws on 0/2+ rows instead of redirect/404. Systemic across all 3 portals. | **FIXED** — repo-wide: 93 sites / 74 files → `.maybeSingle()` (method-chain walker; all had null-guards; `.single()` on other tables left intact). build + tsc green. |
| C-2 | P2 | **rule-12: `account_status NOT IN ('cancelled','expired')` filter missing** on owner-scoped `businesses` reads, slice-wide. Low real risk (one business per owner; RLS+login gate elsewhere). `settings/command`/`scheduler`/`dispatch` pages = reference pattern. | OPEN (catalogue — per-callsite care) |

**Real bugs**

| # | Sev | File:line | Issue | Status |
|---|-----|-----------|-------|--------|
| C-3 | P1 | `appointments/page.tsx:69-71,216` | "SMS Reminder" button POSTs to `/api/sms/reminder` which **does not exist**, then `alert('SMS reminder sent!')` fires unconditionally even on 404. | **FIXED** — Irfan: remove the button. Deleted button + handler + unused `MessageSquare` import. |
| C-4 | P1 | `dashboard/page.tsx:69` | Queries `jobs.job_value` — **column does not exist**. "Revenue captured" tile silently always estimate. | **FIXED** — Irfan: use `avg_job_value`. Now `bookingsThisMonth × businesses.avg_job_value` (added to select; col exists mig 062), fallback to per-call estimate; always labelled estimate. |
| C-5 | P2 | `api/contacts/export/route.ts:19-24` | CSV export had no formula-injection guard. | **FIXED** — apostrophe-prefix guard before existing escaping. |
| C-6 | P2 | `api/portal/waitlist/offer/route.ts:11-15` | Auth `if (expected)` **fails OPEN** if both secrets unset. | **FIXED** — fails closed (500) when no secret configured. |
| C-7 | P2 | `api/portal/drivers/[id]/status`, `dispatch/jobs/[id]/{assign,cancel,complete}` | Insert availability with client-supplied `driver_id`, no ownership check (cross-tenant FK write). NOTE: orphaned/legacy routes (live path is `/api/dispatch/*`). | OPEN (catalogue; low risk, dead code) |
| C-8 | P2 | `api/contacts/[id]` PATCH/DELETE, `api/pipeline/move`, `api/portal/bookings/[id]`+`/confirm` | Mutate by `id` only; ownership relies solely on RLS (present → not exploitable today) but no defense-in-depth `client_id` filter. | OPEN (catalogue — add client_id filters) |
| C-9 | P2 | `calls/page.tsx:685` | "Date" filter pill styled clickable but has no handler — false affordance. | OPEN (P2 batch) |
| C-10 | P3 | `dispatch/{dispatch-board,drivers-view,vehicles-view}.tsx` + `/api/portal/dispatch/*`,`/api/portal/vehicles/*` | Orphaned dead dispatch stack (no callers; sub-pages just redirect). Live path is `DispatchView`→`/api/dispatch/*`. | OPEN (cleanup) |
| C-11 | P3 | `api/contacts/import/route.ts:37-75` | Row-by-row select+insert (N+1). 5000-row cap = up to 10k sequential queries → Vercel timeout risk. | OPEN (catalogue — batching) |
| C-12 | P3 | `catalog/page.tsx:151-180` | In admin-impersonation mode page writes via anon client → RLS scopes to admin's OWN business, so admin edits of a client's catalog silently no-op. | OPEN (admin parity) |
| C-13 | P3 | `billing/page.tsx:144,173,207` | "Auto-pay: Enabled", "14x ROI", "72%" hardcoded marketing copy presented as live data. | OPEN (product confirm) |
| C-14 | P3 | `dispatch/vehicles/page.tsx:3` | Stale comment claims vehicles table dropped (mig 048) but table + routes + join still use it. | OPEN (verify schema) |

**Verified clean:** `requireClient`/`resolveBusinessId`/`requireAdmin` auth solid (clientId from authed user, never client input; admin override gated); RLS enabled+consistent on all client tables (no read IDOR anywhere in client portal); Stripe checkout resolves price IDs server-side (no plan/price bypass); Stripe webhook signature-verified + idempotent; no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` secret leaks; ServiceM8 + Google keys encrypted at rest; Vapi Sync Agent preserves BOTH webhook layers (rule 16) and self-heals June outage; modern bookings schema; reassign/reschedule timezone + double-booking logic correct.

### Live UI findings (Playwright, prod, impersonating Gold Coast Towing demo, 2026-06-06)

Swept all ~38 client screens. **Every screen rendered — no 404s, 500s, white-screens, or crashes.** Three real issues:

| # | Sev | Where | Issue | Status |
|---|-----|-------|-------|--------|
| L-1 | P2 | calls, analytics, bookings, scheduler, appointments (every date/time page) | **Systemic SSR hydration mismatch (React #418).** Server renders dates in UTC, client re-renders in browser TZ (AEST) → mismatch → React discards SSR markup and re-renders client-side. Pages work but flash + log an error every load. Root cause: `toLocaleDateString/Time`/`new Date()` rendered during SSR. | OPEN (one fix: render dates client-only or pass pre-formatted strings) |
| L-2 | P2 | `/analytics` | First client-side Supabase fetch fires with **empty businessId** → `GET …/calls?…business_id=eq.&… 400`, plus Recharts `width(-1)` warning. Confirmed: impersonation does a real session swap, so this is a genuine race (fetch runs before context businessId is read), not a test artifact. Charts can render empty on first load. | OPEN (guard fetch on `if (!businessId) return`) |
| L-3 | P2 | mobile 375px | **Horizontal overflow** — dashboard ~179px (the RevenueStrip non-wrapping row), contacts ~43px. | **FIXED (round 2)** — RevenueStrip now `overflow-x-auto` + items `flex-shrink-0` so the stat row scrolls inside the strip on mobile instead of overflowing the page (desktop fill unchanged). Contacts 43px not yet chased (minor). |
| L-1 | P2 | platform-wide | **#418 hydration mismatch** (UTC server vs AEST client date rendering) on every date page (client + admin). | DEFERRED — dedicated session. Broad (dozens of inline `toLocaleString` calls); cosmetic (pages work, flash + console noise); rushing risks regressions. Fix = shared TZ-pinned date util. |

Confirmed C-3 (appointments fake SMS button) not exercisable on demo — no job rows — but the code path is unchanged from the audit finding.

## ADMIN PORTAL

### Code audit findings (4 parallel slice agents, 2026-06-06)

| # | Sev | File:line | Issue | Status |
|---|-----|-----------|-------|--------|
| A-1 | **P0** | `api/admin/business-preview/route.ts:4-17` | **No auth gate at all.** Uses `createAdminClient()` (service-role, RLS bypass), returns business name/type/preview_number/agent_status for ANY `businessId`. Middleware excludes `/api/`, so reachable by **anyone unauthenticated** → enumerate clients by UUID. Confirmed by 2 agents. | **FIXED** — added `requireAdmin()` gate. |
| A-2 | P1 | `(portal)/admin/demo-accounts/page.tsx:19-27` | Page has **no requireAdmin** — any logged-in client/rep can open it and click "Impersonate" (triggers magic-link into a demo business). Every sibling admin page gates; this one missed. | **FIXED** — added auth+role redirect gate. |
| A-3 | P1 | `(portal)/catalog/page.tsx:154-177` (mirror) | Admin-mirror catalog edits use the **anon browser client** → RLS rejects (admin doesn't own client rows) → **writes silently no-op**; reads also returned empty. Same as C-12. | **FIXED (round 2)** — new `/api/admin/businesses/[id]/catalog` (GET/POST) + `/[itemId]` (PATCH/DELETE), service-role + requireAdmin + audit-logged; catalog page reads+writes route through it in admin mode (anon client kept for owner mode). |
| A-4 | P2 | `api/admin/partner-update/route.ts:9-16` | Hand-rolled admin gate omits `ADMIN_EMAIL` + comma-list support; `.single()` on `users`. Still gated (falls through to role check) but inconsistent. | **FIXED** — replaced with `requireAdmin()`. |
| A-5 | P2 | `api/admin/rep-invoices/[id]/route.ts:30-33` | `pay` action sets `status='paid'` with **no precondition** — can pay a `rejected`/already-paid invoice, no idempotency. Money. | **FIXED** — pay now requires current status `approved` (409 otherwise). |
| A-6 | P2 | `(portal)/admin/clients/page.tsx:18`, `clients/overview/page.tsx:33` | Page super-admin allowlist omits `ADMIN_EMAIL` (only `INTERNAL_ALERT_EMAIL` + hardcoded). A super-admin set only via `ADMIN_EMAIL` is redirected away. | **FIXED** — added `ADMIN_EMAIL`. |
| A-7 | P2 | `(portal)/admin/approve/page.tsx:27` | Hardcoded `'x-admin-key': 'talkmate-admin-2026'` shipped in client bundle. Dead (route ignores it) but a credential-shaped literal. | **FIXED** — header removed. |
| A-8 | P2 | `api/admin/clients/[id]/cancel/route.ts:62`, `impersonate/route.ts:17` | `.single()` on `users` (owner row) → 500 if owner has no mirror row (impersonate path unguarded). | **FIXED** — `.maybeSingle()`. |
| A-9 | P3 | `(portal)/admin/make-setup/make-setup-client.tsx:116` | On-screen Make.com setup docs say `Model grok-2-latest` (rule-10 forbids). Display-only but misleads operator. | **FIXED** — → grok-3. |
| A-10 | P3 | `api/admin/clients/[id]/route.ts:155` | PATCH on bad id returns `{ok:true, business:null}` instead of 404. | OPEN (minor) |
| A-11 | P3 | `(portal)/admin/clients/overview/page.tsx:38` | No `is_demo=false` filter → demo businesses show in overview (main list excludes them). | OPEN (confirm intent) |
| A-12 | P3 | mirror dashboard/insights/chatbot/inbox/train pages | No own `requireAdmin` — rely on layout gate (which IS enforced). Defense-in-depth only, no exposure. | OPEN (optional) |
| A-13 | P3 | `api/admin/sms-failures-count/route.ts:12` | Returns `{count:0}` 200 on auth fail instead of 401. | OPEN (minor) |

**IMPORTANT doc correction (not a bug):** `account_status` CHECK constraint (migration 022) actually allows `pending, active, suspended, cancelled, expired, trial, pending_payment`. **CLAUDE.md rule-15 is STALE** (lists only 5). Code using `trial`/`pending_payment` is valid. → Update rule-15.

**Verified clean (strong):** 64/65 admin routes properly `requireAdmin()`-gated (only A-1 ungated); admin mutations use service-role client correctly; **mirror layout enforces admin → NO cross-tenant breach**; Vapi lifecycle routes (activate/suspend/cancel) never touch webhook layers; **approve-agent + go-live are webhook-layer-safe AND checklist-gated** (cannot repeat June outage); audit-log tamper-resistant + read-only; Stripe payment links priced server-side (no client amounts); bulk lead import solid (caps, rep-active check, server-set assigned_by); sales-resources upload safe (type allowlist + 20MB cap + UUID path + CSP-sandbox serve); commission/clawback money math server-side + state-machine-guarded; `.single()`-on-businesses repo-wide fix holds (none in admin). Mirror edits route through admin-scoped server routes EXCEPT catalog (A-3).

### Live UI findings (Playwright, prod, admin login, 2026-06-06)

Swept all 22 admin screens + the client-mirror. **Every screen rendered — no 404s, 500s, white-screens, or crashes.** Only runtime issue:
- **Same systemic #418 hydration mismatch (L-1)** on date-heavy admin pages (clients/overview, agent-health, and others) — confirms L-1 is platform-wide (client + admin), one root cause.
- Mirror dashboard for the demo client renders correctly under admin (admin-gating + server-side client resolution both work live).
- No new admin-specific live issues.

## SALES REP PORTAL

### Code audit findings (3 parallel slice agents, 2026-06-06)

**The cleanest of the three portals — no P0/P1 IDOR, no money bugs.** `requireSalesRep`/`requireDriver` enforced everywhere; every per-rep/per-driver resource scoped by owner id; commissions + Stripe priced server-side; contractor onboarding token + signing solid.

| # | Sev | File:line | Issue | Status |
|---|-----|-----------|-------|--------|
| SR-1 | P1 | `sales-demo/[industry]/layout.tsx:45`, `settings/page.tsx:43` | **2 `.single()`-on-`businesses` remnants** the repo-wide fix missed (they use `.single<BusinessRow>()` generic form). Rule-1. | **FIXED** — → `.maybeSingle<BusinessRow>()`. |
| SR-2 | P2 | `api/sales/leads/[id]/lost/route.ts:34`, `bad-lead/route.ts:27` | No state guard: a `won` lead can be flipped to `lost`/`bad_lead`, orphaning the pending commission row. | **FIXED** — 409 if `status==='won'`. |
| SR-3 | P2 | `sales/dashboard/page.tsx:441` | "Run demo" quick-action links to `/sales/demo-caller` which **doesn't exist** (→ 404). | **FIXED** — → `/sales/demo`. |
| SR-4 | P2 | `api/driver/location/route.ts:42` | `driver_location_history` insert trusted `body.active_job_id` with no ownership check (driver could attach GPS trace to another driver's job id; bounded). | **FIXED** — verify job belongs to driver first. |
| SR-5 | P2 | `api/driver/invite/accept/route.ts:100` | "Mark accepted" update not gated on `status='pending'` (TOCTOU double-accept; was neutralised by createUser dup-email). | **FIXED** — added `.eq('status','pending')`. |
| SR-6 | P3 | `api/driver/jobs/[id]/photos/route.ts:102` | Photo counter is read-then-write (non-atomic). Single-driver-per-job so safe in practice. | OPEN (optional — RPC increment) |
| SR-7 | P3 | `api/driver/invite/accept/route.ts:61` | Duplicate-email path returns raw Supabase error (confirms an email has an account). | OPEN (optional — generic message) |
| SR-8 | P3 | `api/demo/reset`, `demo/seed` | Use `.single()` on `users` + hand-rolled gate instead of `requireAdmin()`. | OPEN (optional consolidation) |
| SR-9 | P3 | `sales/dashboard/page.tsx:129` | Dead empty loop + `sprintMrrClosed = thisMonthEarned * 3` is an approximation presented as sprint progress. | OPEN (product) |
| SR-10 | note | `lib/demo-config.ts:64` | Demo portal token is a single shared `NEXT_PUBLIC_` secret (by design — reps share one demo link), `===` compare. Not per-rep. All demo writes hard-locked to `is_demo=true` businesses, so safe. | INFO |

**RESOLVES a stale memory:** the "contractor invite email broken" note (Make.com no-op) is now **fixed in code** — post-sign portal-access email always sends with admin-alert on failure; contractor webhooks are Resend-backed. → update that memory.

**Verified clean (strong):** sales-rep IDOR fully scoped (no rep can touch another rep's leads/commissions/invoices/proposals); commission amounts from server-side `COMMISSION_MAP`/`CONTRACTOR_COMMISSION_MAP` (client amounts never trusted); Stripe price IDs + `client_reference_id` set server-side (correct commission attribution); won/close-and-onboard state-guarded (no double-commission); **driver portal: full Supabase Auth users, `requireDriver()` on every route, every job/photo/signature/location/push scoped to the authed driver — no cross-driver IDOR**; driver uploads safe (MIME+size+server path, no traversal); demo writes hard-locked to `is_demo=true` (cannot touch a real client) + `launch-demo` has Vapi-repoint allowlist guardrails; contractor token lifecycle validated (invalid/terminated/signed/expired), ABN+checksum mandatory, hard-fail on PDF/upload (no partial activation), 14-day clawback window enforced; all contractor/commission admin routes `requireAdmin()`-gated.

### Live UI findings (Playwright, prod, 2026-06-06)

- **sales-demo (towing) — all 6 pages swept** (home, calls, bookings, services, settings, team) via the shared demo token. **All render, zero console errors.**
- **`sales/*` rep pages + `driver/*` pages NOT live-tested** — the admin login is not a sales rep (redirects to /admin), and there's no driver login available. Code audit covered both thoroughly (clean). **Live clickthrough of these needs a rep login + a driver login** (or a throwaway rep/driver I can create). Flagged for Irfan.

## SHARED (auth / webhooks / crons)

### Code audit findings (3 parallel slice agents, 2026-06-06)

**No P0. Recurring theme: several webhooks/crons fail OPEN when their secret env-var is unset (latent — all secrets ARE set in prod), plus one genuinely-exploitable open redirect. All 34 crons are auth-gated; every money webhook fails closed today; `vapi/functions` is exemplary (rule-13).**

| # | Sev | File:line | Issue | Status |
|---|-----|-----------|-------|--------|
| SH-1 | P1 | `app/auth/callback/route.ts:8` | **Open redirect** — `?next=` concatenated raw into redirect after a valid session is minted. Exploitable regardless of env (phishing). | **FIXED** — only same-origin relative `next` allowed. |
| SH-2 | P2 | `(auth)/login/page.tsx:39` | Same open-redirect class, client-side (`next`→`window.location.href`). | **FIXED** — sanitised. |
| SH-3 | P2 | `api/auth/register/route.ts:48`, `signup/route.ts:245` | On businesses-insert failure the orphaned **auth user isn't rolled back** → email permanently taken, user locked out on retry. | **FIXED** — `deleteUser()` rollback. |
| SH-4 | P1 | `api/webhooks/vapi/route.ts:146` | **Call-recording webhook failed OPEN** if `VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` unset → forge call records + trigger outbound SMS. Latent (set in prod). | **FIXED** — fails closed. ⚠️ confirm secret set in ALL envs before merge (June-outage-adjacent path). |
| SH-5 | P1 | `api/webhooks/email-trigger/route.ts:28` | Failed OPEN if `CRON_SECRET` unset → fire lifecycle emails for any businessId. | **FIXED** — fails closed. |
| SH-6 | P2 | `api/webhooks/twilio/sms-inbound/route.ts:104`, `sms-status/route.ts:80` | Twilio sig check skipped if `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` unset. | **FIXED** — both fail closed. |
| SH-7 | P2 | `api/webhooks/resend/inbound/route.ts:48` | Accepted unverified inbound email if secret unset (dormant). | **FIXED** — fails closed (401). |
| SH-8 | P2 | `api/stripe/payment-link-paid/route.ts:117` | No event-id idempotency → Stripe retries re-insert duplicate `client_admin_notes` rows (activation idempotent; sig verified). | OPEN (gate the note insert) |
| SH-9 | P3 | `api/stripe/payment-link-paid/route.ts:84` | Plan from raw `price.nickname` not canonical `planFromStripePriceNickname()` (H10 remnant) → typo drift (not money bypass). | OPEN (use canonical mapper) |
| SH-10 | P3 | `api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts:166` | `.single()` on `users` (welcome-email lookup) → missing owner drops email. | **FIXED** — `.maybeSingle()`. |
| SH-11 | P2 | `lib/cron-auth.ts:8` | `verifyCron` ALLOWED when `CRON_SECRET` unset → all 29 verifyCron crons fail-open if env cleared. | **FIXED** — fails closed (500) outside dev. Hardens 29 crons at once. |
| SH-12 | P3 | `api/auth/check-email`, `signup` | Email enumeration (intentional UX) + `listUsers({perPage:200})` only scans first 200 users. | OPEN (accepted / debt) |

**Verified clean (strong):** middleware gates `/dashboard /admin /sales /driver /onboarding /contacts …` (unauth→/login; `/admin` role delegated to pages which DO re-check); duplicate-owner enforced at DB (migration 025 full UNIQUE, rule-5 OK); change-password verifies session + can't target another user; accept-invite token SHA-256 hashed + single-use + role/business from invite (no escalation); **all 34 crons auth-gated** (5 inline already fail-closed); money crons server-side amounts + 14-day clawback; data-retention rule-8 compliant (dry-run default, scoped deletes); Stripe webhook idempotent + sig-verified; **vapi/functions exemplary** (500 if unset, business from verified assistantId not client input, account_status gated); embedded-checkout can't self-upgrade; cloudflare-email + resend + sms-reply already fail closed; no `.single()`-on-businesses remnants. **expire-trials `account_status='trial'` is valid** (confirms rule-15 stale).

### Live UI findings
Auth pages render + function (covered during client/admin sweeps + login). Webhooks/crons are backend-only. No live issues.
